								<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
									<p>Blossom is an application designed to help users manage their busy lives. It is a fully functioning to-do-list application, that also provides motivation to the users with a built-in game that uses completed tasks as the resources that the user needs to grow their digital potted plant.</p>
									<p>The life of a young professional is filled with distractions and excitement. Some of these folks entering the workforce might be living away from their home city for the first time or may be working 2, 3 jobs to pay their rent. It’s not easy out there! With all these pressing concerns, finding time to do housework, and other menial chores can be difficult, and finding the motivation is even harder!</p>
									<p>That’s where Blossom comes in.  Our users complete their tasks and receive points towards keeping a digital potted plant alive. It’s a Tamagotchi game for the modern age if Tamagotchi also helped you do the dishes the same day you used them. The emotional connection to the plant provides more reason to complete a task than just “because I have to.” – You also have a friend to take care of.</p>
									<p>It’s not only young millennials trying to get their home lives together that can benefit from Blossom. Students who can’t seem to show up to class on time, or bodybuilders who really hate doing leg day. Blossom is an app for anyone, anywhere, who struggles to find the motivation to do that one thing every day.</p>
									<p>Blossom will feature a task list, that users can add their own tasks to, and give their task a completion value. Whether it’s shaving every morning, doing the laundry on Saturdays or finishing that paper for English class, each task has a different value for each user. Once they complete the task, they cross it off their list and their digital plant gets a little bigger, a little healthier. If they fail to complete a task on time, however, the plant will wilt.</p>
									<p>We will consider the Blossom Project a success if the app allows the user to easily manage a detailed task list. We will also expect Blossom to provide the user with incentive via a digital potted plant that responds to their numerous successes and failures.</p>
								<h2>Major Features</h2>
									<p>Out of our <a href="https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/brute-force---11-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&label_name[]=Feature">list of features</a>, we have currently implemented four features. These are account management, task management, the points system and a statistics page. With these features, any user of our application would be able to create a new account, login to their account and start creating their to-do-list with new tasks. The user will also be able to modify or delete any current task on their tasklist. In addition, the users will be able to update their account information, view their plant growth based on points they score and an overview of task statistics.

								<h2>Retrospective</h2>
									<p>This group assignment was, unequivocally, a success. Each member pulled their weight, and everyone was understanding and supportive when others could not be there. Early on, we had strong leadership which resulted in clear programming and version control standards, which carried though the various iterations. The version control standards led to relatively smooth introductions to git and version control. The organization of features, user stories, and issues on gitlab proved their worth as we often found ourselves saying "Wait, that's all?" as we approached deadlines.</p>
										
									<p>A well managed team can still make mistakes, however. In the first iteration we realized we would need a "task ID" to identify various tasks. We implemented a hand wavy solution because we got frustrated with the time spent discussing the issue. We knew it would need to be fixed eventually, but it still caught us off guard in the second iteration. We were unable to deliver a bug free release because we took too long to address this design smell. It caused us database headaches and runtime errors. Eventually, we came up with a fix in the third iteration, but it should have been handled much earlier.</p>
									
									<p>We did spend a large portion of our time in the first iteration discussing design, which was frustrating and felt futile, but was also a very good thing. We did most of our work together, which allowed us to have quick discussions about design or bugs. While it might have felt inefficient at first, we realize now that it made the time spent working individually much more productive. Being able to ask a group member what they meant by a comment or working through merge conflicts together was invaluable. We even utilised pair programming later on to great success.</p>

									<p>While were all very happy with our work at the end of each iteration, we failed to identify various code smells. We decided that next time, more rigorous code reviews and would be beneficial to the project. We also repeatedly found ourselves running out of time, as we started late. In iteration 2 particularly, we  failed to allocate time to fix any issues that might crop up, and were punished for it with an unfinished product. We did improve on this slightly in the final iteration, as we were more aware of the time needed to complete the tasks and did not commit to more than  we could complete. </p>
										
									<p>Finally, looking back at our iteration 0, and the vision we had for the product, we definitely overestimated the scope of what features could be added. The plant wilting, or sorting the tasks by tags, or even our stats feature were either pushed to a future release or implemented without much depth. That's not to say that we were not happy with what we accomplished. The plant feature working as intended was a pleasant surprise, as it felt like a daunting feature to complete.</p>
										
									<p>We excelled at managing our tasks, sharing the burden, and communicating with each other. Our time management was lacking, and we should have spent more time with bugs we knew existed. In the end, a was this was successful group project that taught us valuable skills. It's a testament to each member of the group that we can end the semester with by saying "This is fine", and actually mean it.</p>
								<h2>Contributors</h2>
									<p>Blossom was developed by team Brute Force. Brute Force is Ahmed Kidwai, Buu Cao Triet Nguyen, John Manning, Sabit Rahman and Yunpeng Zhong. See below for a description of the skills that each team member gained throughout the development process.</p>
									<h4>Ahmed Kidwai</h4>
										<p>Working on Blossom improved my ability to work with a team. My own time being severely limited helped me develop a new perspective on group members being busy and an understanding that this can happen in life. I am now a more open and understanding developer and respect that not everyone will always have time to contribute. In terms of technical skills, I am really proud of the work I did with writing unit tests. As a software developer I previously focused more of my time on writing code than actually ensuring it does what I want. Writing unit tests for Blossom showed me edge cases and bugs early on, this allowed my group and I to refactor code before different components started interacting heavily with one another. In the future I’d like to continue this style of test driven development.</p>
									<h4>Buu Cao Triet Nguyen</h4>
										<p>I learned about  git version control which is very useful for any developers and will help me prepare for an enterprise environment in the future. Group communication skill also increased a lot as this was my first group project. In this course, I had a chance to get familiar with some work tools like android studio and git. I want to maintain my communication skill which is the most important thing in a group work. I want to stop leaving things to last moment as it always creates a lot of bugs with little time to fix them.</p>
									<h4>John Manning</h4>
										<p>I have an improved understanding of the documentation process. I spent a lot of time writing markdown files and I am now very comfortable with markdown syntax. Seeing how easy it was to add features and tests later in the development cycle gave me a better understanding of how SOLID Principles can improve the architechure of a project. I have learned how git works and am now comfortable with Version Control. I also learned how Android Studio works and am much more comfortable building UI's than I was previously. Working as part of a group was a new experience and helped me build communication and accountability skills.</p>									
									<h4>Sabit Rahman</h4>
										<p>One of the most noteworthy skills I developed during this project is project management. I am now comfortable enough to handle different tasks and also solve different problems of an ongoing big group project. Creating concise project milestones before each iteration gave our team members a better idea of what to achieve in that iteration of the project. Managing different issues on GitLab of the project also helped me to track the state of the project at any given time. On the other side, I have learned how an android application is built from scratch using common software development practices. In addition, I am now quite comfortable using version control system in a project.</p>
									<h4>Yunpeng Zhong</h4>
										<p>During the project, I learned how to work within a team to build a project. Initially, I did not have a good idea on how to collaborate in a group project, but gradually I learned how to use the gitlab to work individually and combine each member's work together. In addition, I also learned how to communicate better with the team members, ask questions when I was confused and get help from them. I also learned the techniques on how to build the project with a clear architecture, which will help me a lot in future projects. On the development side, I also learned how to set up the database and connect it with the application, as well as integration testing and mock tests.</p>
