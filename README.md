# Purpose of the project

 Blossom is a Task Management application that motivates it's users in their daily lives. Completing tasks in Blossom will reward the users with "water" that they can use to grow a digital plant. Enough water will cause the plant to grow taller and stronger!

# Running Blossom

To run Blossom, login using the credentials:
- Username: `username1`  
- Password: `password1`

You can also create your own account by clicking "Sign Up".Once you have logged in, you will be presented with a list of tasks to complete. The tasks have different priorities and due dates. You can create a new task, or complete one that that already exists.

Clicking on a task will bring you to a page where you can edit, delete, or complete the task.

Completing a task awards "water" towards growing your plant. The amount of water gained depends on the priority of the task.

To see your plant, you can click the "Plant" Button at the bottom of your screen. It will bring you to a plant that has a progress bar and a "Water Plant" Button. Watering the plant will empty the progress bar of water and transfer it to the plant! With enough water, the plant will grow larger!

You can also change your account details in user settings.
